# Brain Healing Simulation: The Journey of Neural Plasticity

Have you ever wondered how our brains recover after an injury? This simulation brings to life the remarkable story of neural plasticity - the brain's incredible ability to adapt and heal itself.

Read our detailed blog post about this project: [Simulating Brain Healing: How Neurons Adapt After Injury](https://senva.de/blog/01_neural_plasticity/neural_plasticity_blog.html)

## See It In Action

Watch our demonstration video to see neural plasticity in action:

*This video showcases how neurons adapt, compensate, and recover after simulated damage, providing a visualization of the brain's remarkable healing process.*

## The Brain's Amazing Recovery Story

When our brains face injury or damage, something truly remarkable happens:

1. **The Initial Struggle**: Damaged neurons (shown in black) lose their ability to function - like a light going out
2. **The Helping Neighbors**: Nearby healthy neurons sense something's wrong and begin taking on extra responsibilities (glowing red) - just like neighbors helping during tough times
3. **The Healing Network**: Over time, the entire neural community adapts to make sure essential functions continue
4. **The Diverse Team**: Some neurons adapt quickly to changes (the "first responders") while others are more resilient but slower to adapt (the "steady supporters")
5. **The Comeback Story**: With the right support, damaged neurons can actually recover some function
6. **The Youth Advantage**: Younger neurons tend to adapt faster - the brain's version of youthful resilience
7. **The Ongoing Challenge**: Random damage can continue to occur (similar to progressive conditions)
8. **The Power of Therapy**: External stimulation (like physical therapy) can dramatically accelerate recovery
9. **The Burnout Risk**: Neurons that try to do too much can become stressed - even brain cells need work-life balance!

## Watch the Magic Happen

The simulation shows different perspectives that cycle automatically:
- **Function View**: Watch neurons adapt and compensate in real-time
- **Types View**: See the different "personalities" of neurons
- **Stimulation View**: Observe how therapy-like stimulation helps recovery
- **Health Monitor**: Track the wellbeing of each neuron
- **Connection Strength**: See how neurons build and maintain relationships
- **Age Patterns**: Discover how neuron age affects adaptation

## Track the Recovery Journey

The simulation monitors:
- Active, healthy neurons
- Damaged neurons needing help
- Neurons working overtime to compensate
- Success stories: neurons that have recovered
- Overall stress on the system
- Time progression

## Try It Yourself

```
python neural_plasticity_simulation.py
```

## What You'll Need

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Understanding the Colors

- **Black**: Injured neurons that have lost function
- **Blue**: Healthy, normally functioning neurons
- **Red**: The heroes - neurons taking on extra work to help compensate

## Customize Your Simulation

Adjust these settings to create different scenarios:
- Grid size (brain region size)
- Initial health of the neural network
- Damage location and extent
- How quickly function deteriorates
- How rapidly neurons adapt

## The Science Behind the Story

This simulation draws inspiration from groundbreaking research by Merzenich and colleagues (1984), who discovered that when a finger was amputated, the brain area that once controlled it didn't just shut down - neighboring neurons gradually expanded their territory to make use of this valuable brain real estate.

This beautiful adaptation process is key to recovery from strokes, traumatic brain injuries, and other neurological conditions. The additional elements of neuron types, recovery mechanisms, and the benefits of targeted stimulation reflect our current understanding of rehabilitation therapy and how the brain's remarkable plasticity can be supported to maximize healing potential.

Your brain is constantly rewriting its own story - this simulation offers a window into that inspiring journey of resilience and adaptation.
